Title: The Game of Chess

 
Abstract:

This project introduces a Pygame-based chess game with a structured class system for each piece type, 
including Pawn, Bishop, Knight, Rook, King, and Queen. The Pawn class features a promotion function 
allowing it to transform into any non-King piece upon reaching the opposing board end. The game includes 
mechanisms for piece capture and checkmate detection, ending upon checkmate. A Player class manages 
player attributes, colors, available pieces, and forfeit options. This implementation showcases 
object-oriented design and advanced chess functionalities within a concise framework meeting all the 
technical requirements such as unittesting, UML diagrams, documentations, etc.
