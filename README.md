# OOP-FinalProject

# How to Run
```bash
cd <directory you want to clone in>
git clone https://github.com/walkeredwards/OOP-FinalProject
cd project
python3 chess.py
```
Note: Can't run the game in the container because the graphics card is not linked and it is needed for pygame.

# How to Test
```bash
cd <location where OOP-FinalProject is>
bash ./run.sh
cd project/tests
make all
```

|   Location    | https://github.com/walkeredwards/OOP-FinalProject/tree/main/project |
|    Notes      | 91% Coverage. Didn't really use any software, like Gant chart or Kanban board, outside of github and using a group chat to update each other on progress and meetings. Could have added more testing to get coverage closer to 100%.  |
