Logical view
 • A logical view of the data entities, their static attributes, and their 
relationships. This is the heart of object-oriented design.

Process view
 • A process view that describes how the data is processed. This can take a 
variety of forms, including state models, activity diagrams, and sequence 
diagrams.

Development view
 • A development view of the code components to be built. This diagram 
shows relationships among software components. This is used to show how 
class definitions are gathered into modules and packages.

Physical view
 • A physical view of the application to be integrated and deployed. In cases 
where an application follows a common design pattern, a sophisticated 
diagram isn't necessary. In other cases, a diagram is essential to show how a 
collection of components are integrated and deployed.

Context view
 • A context view that provides a unifying context for the other four views. 
The context view will often describe the actors that use (or interact) with 
the system to be built. This can involve human actors as well as automated 
interfaces: both are outside the system, and the system must respond to these 
external actors.

Common to start with the context view.
